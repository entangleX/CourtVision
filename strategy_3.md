# Strategy 3: Hybrid Expert-Rules and Bayesian Ranking Model

## Best Owner

## Core Idea

Build a conservative, explainable model that combines rankings, grass form, Wimbledon history, and uncertainty penalties into a Bayesian-style player score. This strategy is designed to be robust when data is incomplete, noisy, or hard to model with complex ML.

This should act as our sanity-check model and presentation-friendly fallback.

## Decision This Model Supports

Which players are reliable, explainable quarterfinalist picks when we want to avoid overfitting and keep the reasoning transparent?

## Data Inputs

- Entry ranks.
- Seeds.
- Historical Wimbledon outcomes.
- Grass-court win rates.
- Recent form.
- Head-to-head records when available.
- Official draw sections.
- Injury and withdrawal news.

## Feature Set

Core score:

- Ranking strength.
- Seeding strength.
- Grass-court performance.
- Recent-form performance.
- Wimbledon history.
- Grand Slam consistency.

Uncertainty adjustments:

- Low grass sample-size penalty.
- Recent injury penalty.
- Poor recent form penalty.
- Difficult draw-section penalty.
- Volatile player penalty.

## Modeling Method

Create a weighted score for every player:

```text
base_score =
  0.30 * ranking_score
  + 0.20 * seed_score
  + 0.20 * grass_score
  + 0.15 * recent_form_score
  + 0.10 * wimbledon_history_score
  + 0.05 * grand_slam_score
```

Then apply risk adjustment:

```text
final_score = base_score - injury_penalty - draw_difficulty_penalty - volatility_penalty
```

Use a Bayesian smoothing idea for small samples:

```text
smoothed_grass_win_rate =
  (grass_wins + prior_strength * tour_average_grass_win_rate)
  / (grass_matches + prior_strength)
```

This prevents a player with a 3-0 grass record from being treated as more reliable than a player with a 45-15 grass record.

## Draw Selection

1. Score every player.
2. Split the official draw into eight sections.
3. Rank players inside each section.
4. Select the top adjusted-score player per section.
5. Record the second choice as backup in case of withdrawal or late risk news.

## Validation

Primary metric:

- Mean Top 8 hits on historical Wimbledon years.

Secondary metrics:

- Accuracy by draw section.
- Agreement with seed baseline.
- Upset capture rate.
- Stability of picks when weights are changed by plus or minus 10%.

Guardrails:

- No hidden subjective picks without documented reason.
- Every manual adjustment needs a source or explicit rationale.
- Keep weights simple enough to explain in one slide.

## Strengths

- Very explainable.
- Robust with small data.
- Easy to update quickly before submission.
- Good for final human review.
- Useful if complex models produce suspicious picks.

## Weaknesses

- Less adaptive than machine learning.
- Weight choices are partly subjective.
- May underpredict surprising breakout players.

## Deliverables

- `reports/strategy_3_section_rankings.csv`
- `reports/strategy_3_risk_adjustments.md`
- `submissions/strategy_3_phase1_top8.csv`

## Final Output Format

For each section:

```text
Tour, Section, Pick, Backup Pick, Adjusted Score, Risk Notes
```

## Recommendation

Use this as the explainability and sanity-check track. It should help us defend the final answer even when the more complex models disagree.
