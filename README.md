# CourtVision AI

Predictive analytics and explainable AI project for the EXL Analytics & AI Hackathon 2026, focused on Wimbledon 2026.

## Current Status

As of 24 June 2026:

- The local ATP/WTA ingestion and feature pipelines run successfully.
- Ranking, Elo, grass, recent-form, and rolling-form features are implemented.
- Historical Wimbledon backtests and provisional 2026 Top 8 predictions are available.
- The experimental classifier remains a research track because its Top 8 validation is not yet strong enough for submission.
- The official draw must be incorporated before the Phase 1 selections are finalized.

The source of truth for completed work, team ownership, and next steps is [plan.md](plan.md).

## Mission

Build a credible, explainable, and presentation-ready tennis prediction system that can forecast:

- Men's and women's top 8 quarterfinalists
- Knockout match winners across quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals
- Set-difference signal for knockout-stage scoring

## Team

| Name | Email | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rohit Kumar | rohit6053patel@gmail.com | USA |
| Abhinay Singh | abhi1863@gmail.com | India |

- Harshit: modeling, backtesting, and uncertainty analysis.
- Abhinay: data quality, draw ingestion, and reproducibility.

## Operating Model

We will run like a small product team:

- **Project management:** [Jira Scrum board](https://rohit6053patel.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CV26/boards/3)
- **Knowledge base:** Confluence
- **Code/versioning:** GitHub
- **Async communication:** WhatsApp or Slack free workspace
- **Meetings:** Google Meet
- **AI automation:** Jira/Confluence/GitHub MCP where available, with manual fallback templates

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/process_and_upload.py
python scripts/phase1_model.py
```

The processing script expects these local files:

- `data/atp_tennis.csv`
- `data/wta.csv`
- `data/MS_Entries.pdf`
- `data/LS_Entries.pdf`

Large raw and processed datasets are excluded from GitHub. Team members should obtain the shared source files, place them under `data/`, and run the commands above. Generated features go to `data/processed`, evaluations go to `reports`, and submission artifacts go to `submissions`.

VS Code users can also run `Phase 1: Full local pipeline` from **Terminal > Run Task**.

## Repository Structure

```text
data/                 Raw and processed datasets; keep large data out of git when possible
docs/                 Team docs, sprint plans, meeting agendas, Confluence-ready pages
jira/                 Jira import CSVs and board setup notes
notebooks/            Exploration and modeling notebooks
reports/              Evaluation summaries and presentation-ready outputs
scripts/              Automation and utility scripts
src/                  Reusable project code
submissions/          Final prediction files and submission packages
```

## Definition of Done

A task is done only when:

- Code or document changes are committed to a branch
- Results are reproducible or clearly documented
- Evaluation impact is recorded when the task affects modeling
- Jira ticket is updated with status, owner, and evidence
- Pull request is reviewed before merging to `main`

## Full Project Setup

Follow these steps when joining the project on a new machine.

### 1. Accept Team Access

Make sure you can access each shared workspace:

- **GitHub:** Accept the repository invitation for `entangleX/CourtVision`.
- **Jira:** Open the [CV26 Scrum Board](https://rohit6053patel.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CV26/boards/3) and confirm you can view assigned tickets.
- **Confluence:** Confirm you can access the project knowledge base when pages are shared.
- **Google Cloud:** Accept the Google Cloud invitation for project `AGI-Lab`.

Google Cloud project details:

- Project name: `AGI-Lab`
- Project ID: `agi-lab-499017`
- Project number: `8095576102`
- Access: Harshit Singh and Abhinay Singh have Editor permission

Team members do not need to create separate Google Cloud free trials or add credit cards for this project.

### 2. Install Local Tools

Install these tools before working in VS Code:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- VS Code extension: Cloud Code
- VS Code extension: Python

Recommended Python setup:

- Python 3.11+
- `venv` for local virtual environments
- Jupyter extension for notebooks

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/entangleX/CourtVision.git
cd CourtVision
```

If you use SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:entangleX/CourtVision.git
cd CourtVision
```

### 4. Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

Install recommended extensions if VS Code prompts you. Use the integrated terminal for the rest of setup.

### 5. Configure Google Cloud

Log in with the same Google account that was invited to `AGI-Lab`:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project agi-lab-499017
gcloud config list
```

Confirm the active project is `agi-lab-499017`.

With the Cloud Code VS Code extension, sign in from the Cloud Code status bar and select project `agi-lab-499017`.

Do not commit API keys, service account JSON files, `.env` files, or access tokens to GitHub.

### 6. Create a Python Workspace

Create and activate a local virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the project requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Keep experiments in `notebooks/` and reusable code in `src/` or `scripts/`.

### 7. Explore the Project

- **Sprint plans & decisions:** See `docs/` folder
- **Modeling exploration:** See `notebooks/` (recommended order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04)
- **Jira board:** [CV26 Scrum Board](https://rohit6053patel.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CV26/boards/3)
- **Code standards:** Check branch protection rules before opening PRs

### 8. Start Working

1. Review this README and `plan.md`
2. Open the Jira board and review your assigned Phase 1 task
3. Pull the latest `main`: `git pull origin main`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
5. Commit early and often; push to your branch
6. Open a PR for team review before merging to `main`

## Quick Setup (Initial Onboarding)

If setting up the project for the first time:

1. Repository already created
2. Import `jira/courtvision_ai_jira_backlog.csv` into Jira (if not done)
3. Copy `docs/confluence/*.md` into Confluence pages
4. Ensure all three team members have access to Jira, Confluence, GitHub, Google Cloud, and team chat
5. Use `plan.md` and the active Jira sprint for daily coordination
